##Main Work
```
This is my implementation of the Fixed Point iteration algorithm.
```
##How Program Works?
```
Here are the list of steps:
* Ask user to input the equivalent equation.
* This equation is in string. So, we have to declare the variables from that string.
* I declared variable **x** using **syms command** from **Symbolic Math Toolbox**. 
  Now, we need workable equation from that string so that we can differentiate it.
* After differentiation, It will test whether the equation statisfy the convergence 
  theorem of **Fixed Point Iteration Method** we will do iteration.
